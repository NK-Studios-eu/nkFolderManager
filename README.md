<!-- DESCRIPTION -->
# <img src="assets/img/logo.png" style="height: 25px;"> nkFolderManager - Password protected folders
The name already suggests what the tool can do. But it can do much more than just password-protect folders.
I was tired of constantly protecting folders with .htaccess and .htpasswd. Most web server users are familiar with this. This pop-up window where you enter your login credentials looks incredibly ugly and uninspired.
I programmed a web app with FolderManager that makes the whole thing more attractive and technically sophisticated.
With a full-fledged user system, a user interface, and an ACP for managing accounts and access, the simple pop-up window becomes a more enjoyable experience!
